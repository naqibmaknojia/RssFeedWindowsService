RSS feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically. A standard XML file format ensures
compatibility with many different machines/programs. RSS feeds also benefit users who want to receive

Windows Service which reads RSS feeds every 5 minutes from any two of the Pakistani News Web Site.
The output should be stored in one xml file sorted in descending order of date/time. At every interval, It
will overwrite the contents of the file. The output format should be similar to what is shown below:
<NewsItem>
 
<Title></Title> 
 
<Description></Description> 
 
<PublishedDate></PublishedDate> 
 
<NewsChannel></NewsChannel> 
</NewsItem>
